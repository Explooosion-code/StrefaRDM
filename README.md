## What is StrefaRDM?
StrefaRDM is an open source gamemode written in c# for FiveM platform. ETA for initial release is not known for now. Project will be released shortly as it mostly works. :+1:

## Why?
I couldn't find any simmilar gamemode in the FiveM community that was available for free to everyone, so i thought i will write one by myself.

## Live demo.
If you want to test this gamemode there is a live server at: ████████████████ - Currently not open for public.

## Menu API
This project uses FiveM C# Menu API from [TomGrobbe](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/) link to repo: [MenuAPI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI)

## Roadmap

- [x] Upload C# server-side script

- [ ] Add shop system where you can buy armor
- [ ] Create easly configurable config.json file
