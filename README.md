### What is StrefaRDM?
StrefaRDM is an open source gamemode written in c# for FiveM platform. ETA for initial release is not known for now. Project will be released shortly as it mostly works. :+1:

### Why?
I couldn't find any simmilar gamemode in the FiveM community that was available for free for everyone, so i thought i will write one by myself.

### Live demo.
If you want to test this gamemode there is a live server at: ████████████████ - Currently not open for public.

### Roadmap

- [x] Upload C# server-side script
- [ ] Add more locations to fight in
- [ ] Add global stats of player
- [ ] Add shop system where you can buy armor
- [ ] Create easly configurable config.json file
